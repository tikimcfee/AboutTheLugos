    "This has gotten a bit complicated. Let's start over.",
    "Hello! I'm a Lugo! There are some of us out there, but we are few and far between. I am not, in fact, a province, nor am I a conglomeration of smaller entities masquerading as a Common-speaking computer programmer because that would just be ridiculous right - of course it would. So we can move on knowing that together.",
    "I still feel like we're not quite there yet. Tell ya what. You're free to roam around the links here. Read some words. There are plenty of them. I'd prefer if you *not* try to do things that could make the words broken - ya know, attacking the tiny server this is running on, dropping millions of lines of malicious code intent on spreading itself through the very network you were let in on, or even finding ways to access other interesting devices on the network you may find doing things I didn't know you could do with computers. I mean it's just a preference. Good taste and all that?",
    "Hmm, still complicated.",
    "Anyway.",
    "So yeah here you are. Have fun! Or don't. I dunno what your style is."
